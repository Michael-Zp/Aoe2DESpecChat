TLDR; This is useless.

Even on the same game settings the header of two as identical as possible games is different.
I need more people to test, but I am anxious about asking around. Gotta pump myself up. Just give me some hours or days ^^
An optimal setup would need at least three players. Start a game with two players in the game. The third one spectates and then I can compare the files to find a suitable key to connect the players.
